# DPLearning

This folder contains documentation (code, PowerPoint, and report) from my final project for STAT 672 - Statistical Learning and Data Analytics at George Mason University, Spring 2019. This repository seeks to provide interested readers a centralized place to read about Differentially Private (henceforth referred to as DP) Learning and source relevant code, literature, and illustrative examples on the subject.
I hope to continue updating this repository as I clean up the code and report text and provide greater detail about the materials I sourced when writing this project.
